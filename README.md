# 🚀 Math Game Hacker's Toolkit: Cheating Has Never Been So Fun! 😎
Welcome to the Math Game Hacker's Toolkit, where "playing fair" is just another way to say "losing." Who needs actual math skills when you have JavaScript? This toolkit contains two glorious scripts that will help you hack your way to the top of the leaderboard in the infamous Telegram Math Game.

Why sweat over simple equations when you can let a few lines of code do the heavy lifting for you? Whether you're looking to automatically solve problems or just directly set your dream score, we've got you covered.

## 💻 The Game
Ah, the good old Telegram Math Game. A simple, yet devilishly tricky game designed to test your math skills—or at least it used to until you found this repository. This game comes wrapped in an iframe within Telegram’s interface, but that's no obstacle for a determined hacker like you, right?

### How to Access the Game:
1. Playing on Telegram? No worries! Just log in from a browser, start the game, and locate that sneaky iframe.
2. Locate the Game URL: In the iframe, find the game link. Open it in a new tab, inspect the page, and get ready to unleash some beautifully crafted JavaScript.

### 🛠️ The Scripts
#### 1. mathSolver.js: Automate Your Way to Victory!
